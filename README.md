# Lap-2-Challenge
This project we attempted to create an application where users could anonymously post journal entries, and could view them via following the correct route.

## Installation and usage
- First clone the repo
- Then run docker-compose up in the terminal from the Lap-2-Challenge file.

## Bugs and fixes
- Upon posting a new entry, you are always redirected to the first entry in the api, instead of the latest. 
- Needs fixing by changer the counter in script.js to not set to 0 upon page entry.
